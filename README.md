This repository holds various maps based on the bibliographic metadata provided by [Project Jarāʾid](https://github.com/projectjaraid/jaraid_source) and serialised as TEI XML (`<tei:biblStruct>`). Maps were mostly produced with R and I published a tutorial for doing on the [Open Arabic Periodical Editions project blog](https://openarabicpe.github.io/2021-04-29-mapping-with-r/).
